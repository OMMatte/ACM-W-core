## Getting started
1. Install Git 
2. Install node
3. Navigate to the git repo (the downloaded folder)
4. Run in terminal: **git checkout trainee**. this is to change the branch of the repo to the **trainee** branch.
5. Run in terminal: **npm install**. This installs all dependencies and dev-dependencies specified in the package.json file.
6. Run in terminal: **npm run watch:test**. This runs the tests and every time you change the code inside the src directory. The tests are run again.

## Git
Fact of the day: **Git** is the versioning system. **Github** is just an flexible and visual web-hosted solution based on Git. Other web-hosted solutions based on **Git** exists.

## Node
Node (or NodeJS) is a runtime environment for javascript. In allows us to run javascript code without having it connected to a browser. Basically the equivalent of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for Java.
